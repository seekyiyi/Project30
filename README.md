# Project30
A project to write a small project or study everyweek. All projects are written by Virtualization.

#Preface:

I saw a slide [reflectionsfrom 52 weeks 52 projects](https://speakerdeck.com/jeffersonlam/reflections-from-52-weeks-52-projects),[Project52 Golang](https://github.com/kkdai/project52) and Challengeand felt inspired. So, I hope I could learn something by doing the same challenge myself. Before I graduated from college I will done 30 project.

#Constraint:
* The project could be small or big, but it should be something new not just refactoring an old project.
* To complete a research study or project in everyweek.
* Do not need to create brand new project, you could rewrite some exist project. (But on your own way, not allow to fork and refine.)
