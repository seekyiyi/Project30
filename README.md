A project to write a small project or study everyweek. All projects are written by Virtualization.

#Preface:


I saw a slide [reflectionsfrom 52 weeks 52 projects](https://speakerdeck.com/jeffersonlam/reflections-from-52-weeks-52-projects),[Project52 Golang](https://github.com/kkdai/project52) and Challengeand felt inspired. So, I hope I could learn something by doing the same challenge myself.
